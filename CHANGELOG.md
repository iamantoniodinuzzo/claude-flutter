## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- `skills/github-issue-create`: correct label map to use real repo labels (`enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`); add prerequisite check for template availability on default branch; document sequential-only issue creation
- `skills/github-issue-create`: move SKILL.md to `.claude/skills/` canonical location
- `settings.local.json`: add `Skill(github-issue-create)` to allowlist

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: renamed plugin `superpowers` → `flutter-toolkit` to avoid collision with official Superpowers plugin and fix strict-mode name mismatch that caused "empty" on install
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: aligned `name` to `flutter-toolkit`, removed non-standard `capabilities` and `entrypoints` fields, converted `author` to object per spec
- `.version-bump.json`: added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to `files` list so version bumps propagate correctly
