# Audit Presentation Layer

Statically scans Flutter presentation-layer source and test files against
bundled rule docs. Emits a violations table, then offers targeted fixes.

## Rule source

Rules are bundled locally in `skills/audit-presentation-layer/rules/`.
This skill does **not** delegate to `ai_toolkit/` — it is self-contained.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve input and platform

### Step 1 — Resolve path

Read the user's request and extract one of:

- **Single file**: a path ending in `.dart`
- **Feature folder**: a path containing a `presentation/` directory
- **App root or `lib/`**: a directory containing `pubspec.yaml`, or a `lib/` whose parent has one (enables app-level checks such as WEB-02 and ROUTER-03; a `routing/` folder or the router file itself also enables ROUTER-03)

If neither is clear, ask exactly one question:

> "Provide a widget file path, a feature folder path containing a `presentation/` directory, or an app root."

Do not proceed until a path is confirmed.

### Step 2 — Resolve target platforms

1. Check the user's request for a `--platform=<value>` argument.
   - Accepted values: `web`, `android`, `ios`, `mobile`, `all`.
   - `mobile` expands to `{android, ios}`. `all` expands to `{web, android, ios}`.
2. If no `--platform` argument, read `pubspec.yaml` from the project root.
   Look for the `flutter: { platforms: { ... } }` map (present after
   `flutter create --platforms`). Extract the declared platform keys
   (`web`, `android`, `ios`, `linux`, `macos`, `windows`). Use only
   `web`, `android`, `ios` from this set.
3. If `pubspec.yaml` has no `platforms` map (or cannot be read), fall back to `all`.

**Precedence**: `--platform` arg > pubspec `flutter.platforms` > `all` (fallback).

State the resolved target at the start of Phase 4 output, e.g.:
- `Target platforms: android, ios (from pubspec)`
- `Target platforms: web (from --platform=web)`
- `Target platforms: all (fallback — no platforms map in pubspec)`

### Step 3 — Rule gating

Before applying any rule in Phase 3, check the rule's `Platforms:` tag in
`rules/CATALOG.md`. Skip the rule if its platform set does not intersect the
resolved target set. Rules tagged `all` always run.

---

## Phase 1 — Load rule catalog

Read `skills/audit-presentation-layer/rules/CATALOG.md` in full before scanning.

Do not read individual rule doc files yet — the catalog contains all heuristics
needed for Phase 3. Open a specific rule doc only if you need to clarify a
borderline case or produce a more detailed fix explanation.

---

## Phase 2 — Discover files

### Single-file mode

Target file = the provided `.dart` path.

Check whether a mirrored `*_test.dart` exists under `test/src/`:

```
lib/src/features/<feature>/presentation/<name>.dart
→ test/src/features/<feature>/presentation/<name>_test.dart
```

Include the test file in the scan if it exists.

If the provided file is NOT under `presentation/`, classify it as `domain-file`
(skip the test mirror check) and apply only UI-STR-01 to it.

### Folder mode

Spawn an Explore subagent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  prompt="List all .dart files (excluding .g.dart, .freezed.dart) recursively
  under <input_path>. For each file report:
  - Relative path
  - Whether it is a *_test.dart file
  - Line count (approximate)
  - Widget class name and superclass if visible in first 20 lines
  Report as a plain table."
)
```

Also check for the mirrored `test/src/` path of the given lib/ folder and
include all `*_test.dart` files found there.

Also collect non-`presentation/` dart files under the same feature root
(e.g. `application/`, `domain/`, `data/` siblings of `presentation/`).

Classify each file:
- `widget` — non-test dart file under `presentation/`
- `widget-test` — `*_test.dart` file mirroring a presentation widget
- `domain-file` — dart file outside `presentation/` in the same feature tree
- `web-entry` — `web/index.html`, `web/flutter_bootstrap.js`, `web/*.css` (**app-root/`lib/` mode only**, web target only)
- `router` — a `.dart` file under `lib/` containing `GoRouter(` or `pageBuilder:` (**app-root/`lib/` mode, a `routing/` folder, or the router file passed directly**; mobile target only)

### App-root mode

When the input is an app root or `lib/`, discover Dart files as in folder mode (all `presentation/` trees under
`lib/`) and additionally collect the `web-entry` and `router` files. For a feature folder or other single file, skip
`web-entry` and `router` silently.

---

## Phase 3 — Scan

For each file:

1. Read the full file contents.
2. Apply every heuristic in `rules/CATALOG.md` relevant to the file type **and**
   not gated out by the platform target (see Phase 0 Step 3):
   - `widget` files → apply: RIV-WIDGET-*, REBUILD-*, EXTRACT-*, COHESION-01, COUPLING-*, LAYOUT-*, SIDE-FX-01, ROBOT-04, ROUTER-*, RESPONSIVE-*, ASSET-*, AUTOFILL-*, WEB-01
   - `widget-test` files → apply: ROBOT-01, ROBOT-02, ROBOT-03, ROBOT-05
   - `domain-file` files → apply: UI-STR-01 only
   - `web-entry` files → apply: WEB-02 only
   - `router` files → apply: ROUTER-03 only
3. For each match: record `{file, line_number, rule_id, severity, message, fix_hint, autofix_safe}`.

Heuristic application notes:

- **RIV-WIDGET-01**: flag `ref.watch(` lines where the enclosing method is NOT named `build`. Look at method declarations above the line to determine context.
- **RIV-WIDGET-02**: flag `ref.watch(someProvider)` result where the return value is immediately accessed with `.fieldName` (within 3 lines) and no `.select(` appears on the watch call.
- **RIV-WIDGET-03**: flag `Consumer(` blocks where the `builder:` body exceeds 50 lines.
- **RIV-WIDGET-04**: flag `ref.read(` lines inside a `build(BuildContext` method span.
- **REBUILD-01**: inside `build` spans, flag all-literal constructor calls (`SizedBox(`, `EdgeInsets.*(`, `Icon(Icons.`, literal-only `Text(`, `Divider(`) not preceded by `const` and not covered by an enclosing `const` (check ~3 lines above).
- **REBUILD-02**: flag `MediaQuery.of(context).<prop>` single-property accesses (`size`, `padding`, `viewInsets`, `platformBrightness`, `textScaler`); fix is the scoped `MediaQuery.<prop>Of(context)` accessor.
- **REBUILD-03**: flag `AnimatedBuilder(`/`ListenableBuilder(`/`ValueListenableBuilder(` spans with no `child:` argument and a `builder:` body > ~10 lines.
- **REBUILD-04**: in files with `setState(`, measure the enclosing class's `build(` span; flag each `setState(` call when that span > 50 lines.
- **EXTRACT-01**: flag `build(` method declarations whose span (signature to matching brace) exceeds 80 lines.
- **EXTRACT-02**: flag top-level `Widget name(` declarations (column 0) and `static Widget name(` anywhere in widget files.
- **COHESION-01**: for widget classes with one non-Key constructor field of a non-primitive project type, count distinct `<field>.<member>` accesses in the class body; flag the field when ≤ 2 distinct members are read.
- **COUPLING-01**: in `presentation/` files, flag `import` lines whose path contains `/data/`.
- **COUPLING-02**: in `features/<name>/presentation/` files, flag imports matching `features/<other>/presentation/` where `<other>` ≠ own feature.
- **ROBOT-01**: flag any `find.text(` in `*_test.dart` files.
- **ROBOT-02**: flag any `find.byTooltip(` in `*_test.dart` files.
- **ROBOT-03**: flag all `pumpAndSettle(` lines in test files that also contain `CircularProgressIndicator` or `LinearProgressIndicator`.
- **ROBOT-04**: for each interactive widget found (see catalog for list), check if the same file declares a Key for it; flag if missing.
- **ROBOT-05**: flag public `find…()` methods in Robot classes (method name starts with `find` but no leading `_`).
- **ROUTER-01**: flag `context.push(` and `GoRouter.of(context).push(` in `presentation/` source files.
- **ROUTER-02**: flag `AppBar(` in `*_screen.dart` files where `leading:` is not present in the same `AppBar(…)` span.
- **ROUTER-03** _(mobile target, router file, app-root/`lib/`/`routing/` input only)_: flag a ≤ 3-line helper returning `NoTransitionPage(`/`NoTransitionPage<...>(` (or inline `pageBuilder: ... => NoTransitionPage(`) used by ≥ 50% of `GoRoute` page builders and ≥ 3 routes; one-offs below the threshold never fire. Severity is warning when android/ios is explicitly targeted, info on the `all` fallback. Grep `lib/` for `pageTransitionsTheme:` to pick the message — *theme set but bypassed* vs *no transition strategy* — and note a light/dark mismatch. Fix text: adaptive `PageTransitionsTheme` on both themes + `MaterialPage`; see `flutter-go-router` § Page Transitions.
- **LAYOUT-01**: flag any file with more than one `Scaffold(` occurrence.
- **LAYOUT-02**: flag `Widget _` methods inside widget class bodies.
- **SIDE-FX-01**: flag `showDialog(`, `Navigator.push(`, `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).show`, `addPostFrameCallback(` inside `build(BuildContext` method spans.
- **UI-STR-01**: flag long string literals (> ~20 chars, > 3 words) in files outside `presentation/`.
- **RESPONSIVE-01**: flag `MediaQuery.of(context).size` or `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context)` used in an `if`/ternary branch for layout decisions; also flag `width:` / `height:` values ≥ 100 on `Container(`/`SizedBox(` constructor spans (proxy for hard-coded structural sizing, not small decorative values).
- **RESPONSIVE-02**: flag width-like expressions (`constraints.maxWidth`, `size.width`, `width`) compared against 3–4 digit numeric literals in `if`/ternary/`switch` conditions; skip when the value comes from a named constant (e.g. `AppBreakpoints.compact`).
- **RESPONSIVE-03**: within `Row(` spans, flag the `Row(` line when ≥ 2 children carry `width: <num>` and no `Flexible(`/`Expanded(` appears in the span.
- **RESPONSIVE-04**: flag literal `crossAxisCount: <num>` in `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(` and `GridView.count(` spans, unless computed from constraints/width.
- **ASSET-01**: flag `SvgPicture.asset(`/`Image.asset(`/`AssetImage(` in first-route/shell widgets whose path has no `SvgAssetLoader(`/`precacheImage(` warm-up in startup code; skip engine-registry and `rootBundle`-only assets. Warning for SVG, info for raster.
- **ASSET-02**: needs project root. Flag raster assets whose pixels exceed display logical px × 3 × 1.5, or (display size unknown) decoded `w × h × 4` > 4 MB. Report only.
- **ASSET-03**: needs project root. Flag pubspec-declared assets with no reference; follow `flutter_gen` accessors and runtime-built paths first. Report only — never delete.
- **ASSET-04**: flag warm-ups with no error handler at the creation expression, a cache key that cannot match the widget's (`theme`/`colorMapper`/`bundle`/`DefaultSvgTheme`), or `precacheImage` on engine-managed assets.
- **AUTOFILL-01**: flag a password field (`obscureText: true` or `Password\w*Field`) alongside an email/username field (`TextInputType.emailAddress` or label/controller matching `email|user(name)?|login`) with no `AutofillGroup(` enclosing both in the `build` span.
- **AUTOFILL-02**: flag password/email/name/phone fields lacking `autofillHints:`, and hint/keyboard mismatches (`AutofillHints.email` without `TextInputType.emailAddress`; `AutofillHints.password` on a new-password field in `register|sign_?up|reset|change_?password` files). Skip non-personal fields (e.g. organisation name).
- **AUTOFILL-03**: (a) flag `AutofillGroup(` spans without `onDisposeAction: AutofillContextAction.cancel`; (b) flag the owning `State` when no `finishAutofillContext(` follows an awaited success check — skip forgot-password screens; (c) flag `.clear()`/`.text = ''` on credential controllers textually before `finishAutofillContext(` in the success branch.
- **AUTOFILL-04**: flag classes under `common/`/`shared/`/`widgets/` whose `build` returns `TextFormField(`/`TextField(` and whose constructor has no `autofillHints` parameter.
- **WEB-02** _(web target, app-root/`lib/` input only)_: inspect `web/` for a missing or broken boot loader — (a) no visible `<body>` element before the bootstrap script, (b) custom `flutter_bootstrap.js` without `flutter-first-frame`, (c) top-level `const`/`let`/`class` outside an IIFE, (d) missing `serviceWorkerSettings` without `--pwa-strategy=none`, (e) `display:flex` on `body`. Skip silently outside app-root mode. Fix text: run `/web-loader-init`.
- **WEB-01** _(web target only)_: flag `GestureDetector(` or `InkWell(` blocks containing `onTap:` where no `MouseRegion`, `Focus`, or `FocusableActionDetector` appears as an ancestor within the same `build` method span (~20 lines above). Skip occurrences inside Flutter's built-in button/tile classes.

## Phase 4 — Report

Emit the violations grouped by file. Begin with the resolved platform line:

```
## Audit Results

**Target platforms**: android, ios (from pubspec)

### lib/.../sign_in_screen.dart
| Line | Rule ID | Severity | Message |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 42 | RIV-WIDGET-02 | warning | ref.watch(authProvider) accesses single field — add .select() |
| 88 | LAYOUT-02 | warning | Widget _buildForm() is a build helper — extract to widget class |

### test/.../sign_in_screen_test.dart
| Line | Rule ID | Severity | Message |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 55 | ROBOT-01 | error | find.text('Login') — breaks i18n; use find.byKey(SignInScreen.loginButtonKey) |
| 73 | ROBOT-03 | error | pumpAndSettle() used in file containing CircularProgressIndicator — use pump() |

---
**Summary**: 4 violations across 2 files (1 error, 2 warnings, 1 info)
```

If no violations are found, say so explicitly:

```
No violations found in <path>. All checked rules pass.
```

---

## Phase 5 — Fix prompt

After the report, ask:

```
Apply fixes for which rule IDs? (comma-separated list, "all", or "none")
Auto-fix safe: RIV-WIDGET-02, REBUILD-01, REBUILD-02, ROBOT-05, AUTOFILL-04, AUTOFILL-03 (a only)
Requires judgment: RIV-WIDGET-01, RIV-WIDGET-03, RIV-WIDGET-04, REBUILD-03,
                   REBUILD-04, EXTRACT-01, EXTRACT-02, COHESION-01, COUPLING-01,
                   COUPLING-02, ROBOT-01, ROBOT-02, ROBOT-03, ROBOT-04,
                   ROUTER-01, ROUTER-02, ROUTER-03, LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, SIDE-FX-01,
                   UI-STR-01, RESPONSIVE-01, RESPONSIVE-02, RESPONSIVE-03,
                   RESPONSIVE-04, ASSET-01, ASSET-02, ASSET-03, ASSET-04, AUTOFILL-01, AUTOFILL-02,
                   AUTOFILL-03 (b/c), WEB-01, WEB-02
```

On response:

- **"none"** or no response: done.
- **"all"** or specific IDs:
  1. For each violation matching the selected IDs:
     - If `autofix_safe: true`: apply the edit directly, show diff.
     - If `autofix_safe: false`: show the specific change needed and ask the
       user to confirm before editing. Provide the exact code transformation.
  2. After all edits, re-run Phase 3 on touched files only.
  3. Confirm which violations were resolved.

Never edit files that were not explicitly approved by the user.

## Usage examples

- `audit the presentation layer of features/booking`
- `audit this widget: lib/src/features/auth/presentation/sign_in_screen.dart`
- `find UI violations in features/flight_plan/presentation/`
- `/audit-presentation-layer apps/pollicino_viewer/lib/src/features/booking/presentation/`
- `/audit-presentation-layer lib/src/features/home/presentation/ --platform=web`
- `/audit-presentation-layer lib/src/features/auth/presentation/ --platform=mobile`

---

## Notes

- Paths are relative to the project root — always resolve from there.
- This skill does not shell out to `dart analyze`; it reads files directly.
- It does not overlap with `riverpod-reviewer` (which audits provider declarations)
  or `flutter-analyze-targeted` (which runs the Dart analyzer).
- To add or modify rules, edit `skills/audit-presentation-layer/rules/CATALOG.md` only.
- **Platform gating**: rules tagged `platforms: all` always run. Rules tagged
  `mobile` are skipped on web-only targets; rules tagged `web` are skipped on
  mobile-only targets. When `pubspec.yaml` has no `flutter.platforms` map, the
  target defaults to `all` so no rule is ever silently skipped on legacy projects.
