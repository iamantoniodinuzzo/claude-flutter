name: audit-domain-layer
description: Audit a Flutter domain-layer file or folder against the project's documented clean-architecture rules — dependency isolation (no infra imports), typed exceptions, entity purity (no serialization logic), and hardcoded UI strings. Emits a violations table with file:line and rule ID, then offers to apply fixes. Use proactively when the user says "audit domain layer", "audit this entity", "review domain", "check domain rules", "find domain violations", or asks to verify a domain file against project architecture rules before code review.

# Audit Domain Layer

Statically scans Flutter domain-layer source files against bundled architecture rules.
Emits a violations table, then offers targeted fixes.

## Rule source

Rules are bundled locally in `skills/audit-domain-layer/rules/`.
This skill does **not** delegate to `ai_toolkit/` — it is self-contained.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve input

Read the user's request and extract one of:

- **Single file**: a path ending in `.dart`
- **Feature folder**: a path that contains a `domain/` directory

If neither is clear, ask exactly one question:

> "Provide a `.dart` file path under `domain/`, or a feature folder path containing a `domain/` directory."

Do not proceed until a path is confirmed.

---

## Phase 1 — Load rule catalog

Read `skills/audit-domain-layer/rules/CATALOG.md` in full before scanning.

Do not read individual rule doc files yet — the catalog contains all heuristics
needed for Phase 3. Open a specific rule doc only if you need to clarify a
borderline case or produce a more detailed fix explanation.

---

## Phase 2 — Discover files

### Single-file mode

Target file = the provided `.dart` path.

Classify it:
- `domain-file` if it is under `domain/` in the feature tree.
- If it is NOT under `domain/`, apply `DOMAIN-STR-01` only and state the
  classification at the top of the report.

### Folder mode

Spawn an Explore subagent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  prompt="List all .dart files (excluding .g.dart, .freezed.dart) recursively
  under <input_path>/domain/ (or under <input_path> if it is already a domain/ dir).
  For each file report:
  - Relative path
  - Line count (approximate)
  - First import line (if any)
  Report as a plain table."
)
```

Classify each file as `domain-file`.

---

## Phase 3 — Scan

For each `domain-file`:

1. Read the full file contents.
2. Apply every heuristic in `rules/CATALOG.md`:
   - All rules apply to `domain-file` targets.
3. For each match: record `{file, line_number, rule_id, severity, message, fix_hint, autofix_safe}`.

Heuristic application notes:

- **DOMAIN-DEP-01**: flag any `import 'package:cloud_firestore/...`, `import 'package:http/...`,
  `import 'package:dio/...`, `import 'package:firebase_core/...`, or any other infra/data-layer
  package in a file under `domain/`. Domain files may import `package:riverpod_annotation` and
  core Dart/Flutter-dart (non-widget) packages without triggering this rule.
- **DOMAIN-FAIL-01**: flag `throw Exception(`, `throw StateError(`, or any `throw` whose
  expression does not start with a class name that plausibly extends `AppException` or a named
  feature-level abstract exception. Also flag `throw ArgumentError(` and similar stdlib errors
  when inside domain logic (not in factory constructors performing validation).
- **DOMAIN-ENT-01**: flag method or factory declarations matching `fromJson(`, `toJson(`,
  `fromMap(`, `toMap(`, or a parameter of type `Map<String, dynamic>` in entity/value-object
  classes directly in `domain/`. Do NOT flag model classes under `domain/` if the file name
  ends in `_model.dart` (data-layer model accidentally placed; flag separately as an info note).
- **DOMAIN-STR-01**: flag string literals matching `'[A-Za-z ]{20,}'` (≥ 20 chars, proxy for
  multi-word human-readable copy) that are not in comments and not assigned to `const` technical
  identifiers (e.g. `url`, `path`, `key`, `tag`, `code`).

---

## Phase 4 — Report

Emit the violations grouped by file:

```
## Audit Results — Domain Layer

### lib/.../auth/domain/app_user.dart
| Line | Rule ID | Severity | Message |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 12 | DOMAIN-ENT-01 | warning | fromJson() in entity — serialization belongs in the data-layer model |
| 34 | DOMAIN-STR-01 | info | Hardcoded string 'User not found in database' — use typed exception message |

---
**Summary**: 2 violations across 1 file (0 errors, 1 warning, 1 info)
```

If no violations are found, say so explicitly:

```
No violations found in <path>. All checked rules pass.
```

---

## Phase 5 — Fix prompt

After the report, ask:

```
Apply fixes for which rule IDs? (comma-separated list, "all", or "none")
Auto-fix safe: (none)
Requires judgment: DOMAIN-DEP-01, DOMAIN-FAIL-01, DOMAIN-ENT-01, DOMAIN-STR-01
```

On response:

- **"none"** or no response: done.
- **"all"** or specific IDs:
  1. For each violation matching the selected IDs:
     - If `autofix_safe: true`: apply the edit directly, show diff.
     - If `autofix_safe: false`: show the specific change needed and ask the
       user to confirm before editing. Provide the exact code transformation.
  2. After all edits, re-run Phase 3 on touched files only.
  3. Confirm which violations were resolved.

Never edit files that were not explicitly approved by the user.

## Usage examples

- `audit the domain layer of features/auth`
- `audit this entity: lib/src/features/auth/domain/app_user.dart`
- `find domain violations in features/booking/domain/`
- `/audit-domain-layer lib/src/features/auth/domain/`
- `/audit-domain-layer lib/src/features/booking/`

---

## Notes

- Paths are relative to the project root — always resolve from there.
- This skill does not shell out to `dart analyze`; it reads files directly.
- It does not overlap with `riverpod-reviewer` (which audits provider declarations in
  the application layer) or `audit-application-layer` (which audits notifier/provider code).
- To add or modify rules, edit `skills/audit-domain-layer/rules/CATALOG.md` only.
