Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for shared toolkit instructions.

Multi-agent toolkit for Flutter/Dart (Riverpod v3, GoRouter, clean architecture, Melos).
Toolkit repo — application paths resolve from the **target Flutter project root**; bundled resources resolve from each installed skill directory.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, update the graph only with a supported local command. If the installed CLI lacks `update`, retain the freshness warning and do not claim the historical graph reflects new changes. Do not run paid semantic extraction as a validation step.
